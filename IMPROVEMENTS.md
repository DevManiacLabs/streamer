- Added better error messages

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments throughout the codebase
- Created an improved README.md with project structure and setup instructions
- Added inline comments for complex logic
- Documented all exported functions and interfaces
- Created this IMPROVEMENTS.md to track enhancements

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

### Input Handling Optimization
- Implemented debouncing for search inputs to reduce API calls
- Used the centralized config for consistent debounce timing
- Optimized event handlers to prevent unnecessary renders

### API Fetching
- Implemented proper caching strategies for network requests
- Used Next.js cache headers for better performance
- Reduced redundant API calls

### React Query Optimization
- Implemented stale-while-revalidate patterns
- Set appropriate cache times for different types of data
- Used query key factories for better cache management
- Implemented fallback data patterns

### Error Handling
- Added proper error boundaries
- Implemented consistent error handling patterns
